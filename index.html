	<p>Never in all their history have men been able truly to conceive of the world as<br> one: a single sphere, a globe, having the qualities of a globe, a round earth in<br> which all the directions eventually meet, in which there is no center because<br> every point, or none, is center - an equal earth which all men occupy as equals.<br> the airman's earth, if free men make it, will be truly round: a globe in practice,<br> not in theory.</p>
	<br>
	<p>Science cuts two ways, of course: its products can be used for both good and <br>evil. But There's no turning back from science. The early warning about<br>
	technological dangers also come from science.

	 <p>What was most significant about the lunar voyage was not that man set foot on<br> the Moon but that they set eye on the earth.

	 <p>A Chinese tale tells of some men sent to harm a young girl who, upon seeing her<br> beauty, become her protectors rather that her violators. That's how i felt deeing<br> the erath for the first time. I could not help but love and cherish her.

	 <p>For those who have seen the earth from space, and for the hundreds and<br> perhaps thousands more who will, the experience most certainly changes your<br> perspective. The things that we share in our world are far more valuable than<br> those which divide us.

<h2>The Final Frontier</h2>

<div class="par">
	<p>There can be no thought of finishing for 'aiming for te stars.' Both figuratively<br> and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much <br> progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.</p>

	<em class="diferent">The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow. Science has<br> not yet mastered prophecy. we predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for<br> the next ten.</em>

	<p>Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a<br> group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in<br> accordance with the natural laws of human development.</p>

<h2>Reaching for the Stars</h2>

<div class="par">
	<p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it<br> shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful youcan imagine. That<br> beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that uf you touched it<br> with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>

	<p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its<br> five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new<br> civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.</p>
	<br>
	<p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize<br> there's fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is<br> exploration at its greatest.</p>
